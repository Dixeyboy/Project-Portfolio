<h1>My Favourite Movies List</h1>
<br />
<h2>Top 3</h2>
<hr \>
<h3>1. The Lord of the rings trilogy</h3>
<p>I couldn't decide which movie of the 3 were better so the whole trilogy is my number 1. The greatest trilogy of movies of all time</p>
<h3>2. Die Hard</h3>
<p>What a classic 80's CHRISTMAS (100%) action movie. so many quotable lines! yippee ki-yay...</p>
<h3>3. Aliens</h3>
<p>I absolutely love Aliens. Classic action sci-fi movie. preys on the fear of the unknowns of space...</p>

<!-- This was fun ranking my top movies, I could not decide which film out of the Peter Jackson's LOTR trilogy 
   I liked more so I chose all 3'-->
